  key_converter:
    description: |
      Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that
      is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the keys in messages written to or read 
      from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors, it allows any connector to work 
      with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.
      
      Note: For custom converters, the library files should be provided to the charm beforehand
      using `juju attach-resource` command. Please refer to the docs for more details.
